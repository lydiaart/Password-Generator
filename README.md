# Password Generator Starter Code

## Description

This is a password generator. Users could choose and combine from four different criteria which are lower case letters, upper case letters, special characters, and numbers to generate random passwords. Before the criteria options, users need to select the length of the password between 8-128. When the length of the password does not meet the requirement, a friendly reminder will show up. The user also needs to choose at least one of those criteria options to generate the password. The screen is designed to fit into different media sizes.
